  "summary": "The diff demonstrates comprehensive implementation of both requirements. REQ-1 is fully addressed with ₹ symbol display across ProductCard, CartItem, Cart, and Checkout components. REQ-2 is implemented through backend migration, hardcoded default price in addProduct/updateProduct functions, and a disabled price field in ProductForm showing ₹20. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asks to set the default/current product price to 20, not to migrate existing products. The migration.mo file implements a data migration that updates all existing products' prices, which was not explicitly requested.",
