  "summary": "The diff shows fixes for admin panel authentication/authorization logic and product fetching. REQ-1 is addressed with proper authentication checks and debug logging in AdminPanel.tsx. REQ-2 and REQ-3 are addressed by fixing the useGetAllProducts hook to call actor.getProducts() instead of actor.getAllProducts(), with comprehensive error logging and proper empty state handling in ProductCatalog.tsx. Backend getProducts() method is shown to be implemented correctly. All three requirements appear to be implemented.",
