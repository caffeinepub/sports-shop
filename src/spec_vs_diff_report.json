  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements from the BuildRequest. REQ-1 is addressed by adding the admin panel link to the header navigation in Layout.tsx with proper conditional rendering. REQ-2 is not directly visible in the diff (router configuration may be unchanged or truncated), but the admin panel page component is confirmed to exist. REQ-3 is implemented through the useIsCallerAdmin hook in useQueries.ts with proper authentication checks.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Verify that the /admin route is properly configured and accessible in the router configuration, ensuring it renders the AdminPanel page component",
      "reason": "The diff does not show changes to the router configuration file (App.tsx is truncated). While the AdminPanel component is referenced in Layout.tsx and exists in the file summaries, there is no visible evidence in the diff that the /admin route was verified, added, or modified in the router setup.",

      "description": "AdminUserManagement component with grant admin role functionality",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states as a non-goal: 'Modifying admin user management functionality'. The diff shows a complete new/modified AdminUserManagement.tsx component with functionality to grant admin roles to other users via principal ID input, which goes beyond restoring access and modifies admin user management capabilities.",
