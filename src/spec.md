# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix admin panel access and resolve product display issues in the catalog.

**Planned changes:**
- Debug and fix the admin panel route (/admin) to allow proper access for admin users
- Fix the product catalog page to correctly display all products from the backend
- Verify and fix the getProducts query and data fetching between frontend and backend
- Ensure proper error handling and loading states for product display
- Add appropriate empty state when no products exist in the database

**User-visible outcome:** Admin users can access the admin panel successfully, and all products stored in the backend are visible and correctly displayed on the product catalog page with images, names, prices, and add-to-cart buttons.
