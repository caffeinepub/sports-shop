# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix custom pricing functionality for sports stickers to enable setting, saving, and displaying custom prices correctly.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix custom price input and conversion (rupees to paise) in the sports sticker creation form
- Ensure backend properly stores and retrieves custom prices for sports categories
- Fix price display conversion (paise to rupees) in stickers gallery and cart for sports items
- Verify price handling works consistently for both table tennis and badminton categories

**User-visible outcome:** Users can successfully set custom prices for sports stickers, which display correctly throughout the application including the gallery and cart.
